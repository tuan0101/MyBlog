# Low vs. High Language
**Machine Code** could probably a lowest level programming language that is as close as possible to what the CPU can understand.
 
**Assembly languge** is at the level of telling the processor what to do.

**C** is one of the most oldest, but popular languages that being used up until to day.
Many of the other major programming languages of today have their roots in C.
It is very low-level, allowing developers to access the memory on a computer directtly and to manipulate many low-level parts of the computer. That's why C is being used in many operating systems, level hardware, embedded systems.

**C++** is technically a superset of C, that it provide some more useful features from Simula, adding object orientation, classes, virtual functions. 
C++ is widely used, especially in game development. it's extremely powerful, but also a very complex language.

**C#** was originally created by Microsoft as the flagship language of the .NET Runtime. 
C# is very, very similar to Java. We can say C# is the combination of C++ and Java, but is much simpler and has many funtional features.

**Java**
The idea when Java was created was that it could run on a virtual machine which could run on any computing platform, thus enabling Java programs to be easily cross-platform.

**Python** is higher level, and remove a lot of details that you would need to specify in Java or C#

**JavaScript** is high-level, given its flexibility (functions as objects), often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. 

**SQL** is of highest languages. In SQL, you are programming the logic of querying or manipulating the data  stored in a database that can run anywhere.

**IN CONCLUSION**

low level = long development time + very fast executable file

high level = shorter development time + slower executable file

But it's not always the case. A highe level programming language isn't necessarily slower than a low level programming language. For intance, **Scala** is higher level compared to **Java** but provbides many ways to work with multithreading and collections that perform better than it's java's equivalent. ------*StackOverflow*------
