# Design Patterns Introduction
Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices or proven solutions to commonly occuring problems. Given a certain problem, you may be able to come up with a solution on your own but it may not be best. Design Pattern helps you to solve the problem in the optimal way, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP). However, it doesn't have to be tied to OOP. Design Pattern is not limited to one programming paradigm.

>“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our. environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this. solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.”
