**Single responsibility** states that each module, class, or function is responsible for one thing and encapsulates only that part of the logic.  
**Open-closed** states that classes must be open for extension but closed for modification; that means structuring your classes to create new behavior without modifying the original code.  
**Liskov substitution** states that derived classes must be substitutable for their base class when using inheritance.  
**Interface segregation** states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Clients should only implement what they need.  
**Dependency inversion** states that high-level modules should not import anything directly from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
