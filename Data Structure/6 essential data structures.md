### 6. Set
Set is a special data structure, which doesn't allow duplicates. It's a good data structure to store unique elements like Ids, for example, EmployeeId, OrderId, TradeId, etc. Whenever you are storing data that needs to be unique then you can use Set data structure. If you try to insert duplicates Set will not accept it and its method will return false to indicate that insertion has failed.
